# Learning Statistical Genetics using R
My statistical genetics explorations in R. 

### Project title: Statistical Analysis of some Genotype-Trait Associations using R
- The focus of this project was to use R to learn the techniques of handling real genetic data arising from the population-based study of unrelated individuals.
- The main reference was “Applied Statistical Genetics with R” by Andrea S. Foulkes for studying multiple testing concepts like inflation of type-1 error, family wise error rate, false discovery rate, and multiple adjustment techniques like Bonferroni adjustment, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment, and Tukey’s honestly significantly
different test.
- I learned to quantify the departure from linkage equilibrium and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using real data sets in R, and observed the effect of population substructure on the measures of departure.
